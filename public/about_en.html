                <h2>Let me introduce myself...</h2>
                <p>
                  I was born on June 1, 1968, grew up in Haaksbergen, and after obtaining 
                  my VWO diploma, I moved to Wageningen to study Environmental Hygiene at 
                  the Agricultural University. I graduated in 1993 and worked for 3 years 
                  in the field of environmental research and policy, lastly at Tennet, 
                  which at the time operated under the name SEP (Cooperating Electricity 
                  Production Companies). At SEP, I was involved in setting up an 
                  automated system that provided environmental data required as input 
                  for the mandatory annual environmental report. After the implementation, 
                  I took on the role of functional manager of this system. Due to the 
                  "last in, first out" principle, I was laid off a year later as part of 
                  a restructuring.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <img src="../assets/images/wie-ben-ik-2.jpg" alt="" />
              </div>
            </div>
          
            <p>
              During my studies in Wageningen, it was already mentioned that only a small 
              number of graduates find work in their field of study, and that applied to me 
              as well. I was retrained by the Ministry of Defense as an IT specialist, with 
              a focus on COBOL, at the DTO (Defense Telematics Organization), the automation 
              company of the Ministry of Defense.
            </p>
          
            <p>
              During my DTO training, it was often suggested that COBOL was gradually 
              disappearing. Nothing could be further from the truth! It is still widely used 
              by banks, insurance companies, and government institutions, where it is 
              responsible for billions of transactions per day. COBOL still plays a crucial 
              role in the IT sector and often forms the backbone of critical business 
              processes, where reliability and stability are essential for daily operations.
            </p>
          
            <p>
              Of course, I have been involved in decommissioning projects during my career, 
              but I have also participated in maintenance and new development projects where 
              optimization and modernization (integrating new technologies) played/continue 
              to play a significant role. Unfortunately, it must be acknowledged that 
              there is little new talent entering the field of COBOL IT. The language is 
              often regarded as (very) old and unappealing. On the other hand, the language 
              is understandable and easy to read. It often operates in very complex 
              environments, which presents a significant challenge to make the software do 
              what it is supposed to do. There are, of course, tools that make COBOL 
              development more modern, such as Microfocus COBOL.
            </p>
          
            <p>
              Okay, that's enough about COBOL for now; after all, this website isn't meant 
              to be an entire plea for COBOL but is intended to keep myself working. I am 
              no longer dependent on the language, as I have gained enough experience as a 
              functional designer, which I can practice independently of any platform. 
              However, I do have a preference for a COBOL platform, as I still enjoy 
              programming and/or testing in it.
